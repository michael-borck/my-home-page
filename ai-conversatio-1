Please write the minimal program using RAG
Copilot said:

Here is a minimal Python program using the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) module from the hands-on-ai package, based on the reference guide you provided:




Python
from hands_on_ai.rag import index_documents, query_documents
# Step 1: Index your documents (only needs to be done once per document set)
index_path = index_documents("path/to/docs/", output_file="my_index.npz")

# Step 2: Query the indexed documents
response = query_documents("What is machine learning?", index_path=index_path)
print(response)
How it works:

index_documents creates a vector index from your documents (e.g., PDFs, text files, etc.).
query_documents lets you ask questions about the indexed content, and the LLM will answer using retrieved context.
Minimal requirements:

Replace "path/to/docs/" with the folder containing your documents.
The index is saved as "my_index.npz" (you can change this name).
You can now ask any question about your documents.
Would you like an example using specific file types or a CLI (command-line) version?









Provide CLI usage example

Explain how to customize the index path
